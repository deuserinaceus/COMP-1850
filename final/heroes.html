				Geralt of Rivia is a witcher and the main protagonist of the
				Witcher series by Andrzej Sapkowski and its adaptations,
				including The Witcher, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, and
				The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt video games. Like all witchers, Geralt
				is a monster hunter for hire. He possesses superhuman abilities
				and is a master swordsman. During the Trial of the Grasses,
				Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance for the mutagens that grant
				witchers their abilities. Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to
				further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and
				may have given him greater speed, strength, and stamina than his
				fellow witchers. Geralt is also known as Gwynbleidd, meaning
				"White Wolf" in Elder Speech. He was given this alias by the
				dryads, and is also called the Butcher of Blaviken after an
				unfortunate incident in that town. Despite his title, Geralt
				does not hail from the city of Rivia. After being left with the
				witchers by his mother, Visenna, he grew up in their keep of
				Kaer Morhen in the realm of Kaedwen. In the interest of
				appearing more trustworthy to potential clients, young witchers
				were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master
				Vesemir. As his first choice, Geralt chose "Geralt Roger Eric du
				Haute-Bellegarde", but this choice was dismissed by Vesemir as
				silly and pretentious, so "Geralt" was all that remained of his
				chosen name. "Of Rivia" was a more practical alternative and
				Geralt even went so far as to adopt a Rivian accent to appear
				more authentic. Later, Queen Meve of Lyria knighted him for his
				valour in the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga conferring on
				him the formal title "of Rivia", which amused him. He,
				therefore, became a true knight of Lyria, only to lose the title
				soon after for departing.
