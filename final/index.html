						<h2>What is it?</h2>
						<p>
							The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (Polish: Wied≈∫min 3: Dziki
							Gon) is the third and final installment in the
							series of games developed by CD Projekt RED
							featuring the witcher Geralt of Rivia. The game was
							originally scheduled for release in late 2014, then
							pushed back to 24 February 2015, and finally
							released on 19 May 2015. During the first two weeks
							since release it had sold more than 4 million copies
							worldwide, more than doubling the total sales of its
							predecessor The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings.
							Unlike the previous games, The Witcher 3 is set in a
							multi-region open world, featuring over 100 hours of
							content. Several early articles mentioned that the
							developers planned to have an open world similar to
							that in Skyrim, but 20% larger. The devs were quick
							to point out that while there was much to appreciate
							in Bethesda's open world concept, they were also
							making an effort not to repeat what they perceived
							as the flaws in-game. As with earlier games, the
							consequences of Geralt's actions will impact how the
							narrative progresses. The game has been built using
							the new REDengine 3 and was designed with player
							feedback from fans of previous Witcher games in
							mind.
